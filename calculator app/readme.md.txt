a simple calculator app build with python and tkinter , created it as my first project to practice python and gui development Welcome to my very first software project! This calculator was built using Python and Tkinter as a way to dive into GUI development, learn layout management, and understand how real-world applications are structured and packaged.

About the Project This is a simple yet functional calculator app that supports:

Basic arithmetic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, exponentiation
Real-time input display using StringVar
Button-driven input with a clean number pad and operator pad
Cursor movement and backspace functionality
Packaged as a standalone .exe with a custom icon and no terminal window
Why I Built This I wanted to learn how to:

Build a GUI from scratch using Tkinter
Understand layout systems like grid() and pack()
Use StringVar to dynamically update the display
Handle button events and modularize logic
Package Python apps using PyInstaller
Add polish with icons, styling, and user-friendly design This project helped me explore event handling, widget placement, state management, and distributionâ€”all in one go.
The app may have some problem but I will try to better it with time
